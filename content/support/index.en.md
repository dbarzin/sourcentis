## Customization

Does your organization have specific needs? We develop custom features for Mercator and Deming to ensure their seamless integration into your IT environment.

Customization projects are priced based on their complexity.

## Hosting

At Sourcentis, we choose trust and open source. Unlike other solutions, we do not offer cloud hosting for our Mercator and Deming tools.

Why? Because we firmly believe that your sensitive data, whether it's mapping your information systems or managing your ISMS, should remain where it's most secure: under your direct control, within your own infrastructure.

This unique positioning gives you complete control over your information, protected from the risks associated with sharing or outsourcing data to third-party environments. At Sourcentis, our priority is to support you in this process while respecting your confidentiality and security requirements.

## Open Source Support

At Sourcentis, we are proud to support and develop open source solutions that meet the complex needs of modern organizations. In addition to our technical support services, we have designed a sustainability support program for our open source projects to ensure their continued evolution and lasting impact.

By subscribing to this program, your organization becomes a key player in the Mercator and Deming ecosystem. Your contribution helps fund not only the maintenance and enhancement of existing features, but also the integration of innovative new features, security enhancements, and performance optimizations. In return, your logo will be prominently displayed on our website, recognizing your company as an official supporter of these projects.

Joining our support program not only means investing in powerful and tailored tools, but also affirming your commitment to open source and collaboration. Together, we are shaping a more open and sustainable digital future.
