Sourcentis is now a [Pépite de la Tech](https://lespepitestech.com/startup-de-la-french-tech/sourcentis) !

We are very pleased to announce that Sourcentis has been referenced among the French Tech Nuggets! 🎉

This is a great recognition for our young company and for the two open source projects we actively support: Mercator, our information system mapping tool, and Deming, our ISMS management solution.

These tools, designed and developed to meet concrete cybersecurity needs, are already used by several hospitals, universities, banks and public institutions. This spotlight on Les Pépites Tech is a further step towards our goal of promoting a transparent, collaborative and sovereign cybersecurity model, rooted in open source.

Thank you to all those who support us in this adventure. 🙏
And if you don't already know about our projects, now's the perfect time to find out!
