The implementation of the European directive [NIS2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj) is fast approaching.

I’m pleased to be speaking at the [NISDUC](https://www.nisduc.eu/forth-conference) conference on May 6th, 2025, where I will present how essential and important entities can implement the security measures required by NIS2 through an open source approach with [Deming](https://github.com/sourcentis/deming).
