📢 New Framework Available in Deming: HDS

Good news for healthcare professionals and health data hosting providers! The **HDS framework (Hébergeur de Données de Santé)** is now integrated into **Deming**, our open source tool for managing Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).

🎯 Why It Matters

The HDS framework applies to all organizations that host personal health data. It introduces strict requirements for security, traceability, and governance, complementing standards such as ISO 27001 and ISO 20000.

🛠️ What This Brings to Deming

- The HDS framework is available in the **frameworks** section: you can add it to your ISMS and manage compliance in a centralized way.

- Each requirement is linked to concrete actions: policies, procedures, controls, technical measures, and more.

- You can track your compliance level, identify gaps, and manage your remediation plans.

💡 And as always: everything is customizable, versioned, collaborative, and open source.
