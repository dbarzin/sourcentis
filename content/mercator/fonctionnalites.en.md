## 🎯 Unified Business-Technical Mapping with BPMN 2.0

**New in 2026**: Mercator now integrates business process modeling using the **BPMN 2.0** (Business Process Model and Notation) standard, creating a unified mapping where your business processes are directly linked to your technical infrastructure.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2em; align-items: flex-start; margin: 1.5em 0; flex-wrap: wrap;">
<div style="flex: 0 0 40%; min-width: 300px;">
{{< img src="/images/BPMN.png" width="100%" >}}
</div>
<div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">

**360° view of your organization**:
- Model your business processes using the BPMN 2.0 standard notation
- Link each task to the applications, servers, and infrastructure that support it
- Identify the technical impact of a business process change
- Assess the business impact of a technical incident

**Strategic use cases**:
- **Impact analysis**: A critical server goes down? Instantly visualize which business processes are affected
- **Optimization**: Identify processes relying on obsolete or at-risk infrastructure
- **NIS2 compliance**: Document essential processes and their technical dependencies
- **Communication**: A common language between business teams, IT, and management

## 🌐 Multi-view: Visualize Your IT from Every Angle

Mercator allows you to explore your information system from five complementary perspectives, each tailored to a specific need.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2em; align-items: flex-start; margin: 1.5em 0; flex-wrap: wrap;">
<div style="flex: 0 0 40%; min-width: 300px;">
{{< img src="/images/network.png" width="100%" >}}
</div>
<div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">

**Available views**:
- **Ecosystem view**: Relationships with your suppliers, partners, and external entities
- **Application view**: Application mapping and their interconnections
- **Logical infrastructure view**: Network architecture, security zones, data flows
- **Physical infrastructure view**: Datacenters, server rooms, hardware equipment
- **Business process view**: Workflows and their technical support (Enterprise)

Each view is interactive and allows natural navigation between different perspectives to understand relationships and dependencies.
