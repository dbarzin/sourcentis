## 📋 FAQ Pricing and Enterprise

### What is the difference between Open Source and Enterprise?

The **Open Source** version is the complete, free software. The **Enterprise** version adds professional support with an SLA, training and support services, as well as additional modules.

### How do I upgrade from Open Source to Enterprise?

It's very simple: contact us for a quote, we'll draw up a contract, and your existing installation will continue to run with added support. No technical migration is required.

### Can I switch back to Open Source after using Enterprise?

**Yes**, there is no lock-in. You can cancel your Enterprise contract at any time and continue using the Open Source version. Your data and configurations remain intact.

### What support is included in the Open Source version?

Community support via GitHub (Issues and Discussions). The community is active and responsive, but response times are not guaranteed.

### What support is included in Enterprise?

Professional support with an SLA: guaranteed response time, email support, priority escalation, and hotfixes within the contractual timeframe.

### Why are some features exclusive to Enterprise?

The **BPMN 2.0 modeling** and **cartographer management** features are advanced developments requiring significant support and maintenance. They are primarily aimed at large organizations with complex collaboration and business modeling needs. Funding through the Enterprise version allows for the continued development of the Open Source version for the entire community.

### Do the prices include BPMN and mapper management features?

**Yes**, all Enterprise features (BPMN 2.0 and mapper management) are included in all SLA levels (Standard/Premium/Platinum). The difference lies in the level of support and assistance.

### Can I purchase only the BPMN features without support?

No, the exclusive Enterprise features (BPMN and mapper management) are only available with an Enterprise support contract. This guarantees professional support for these advanced features.

### Are there discounts for non-profit organizations?

Yes, we offer preferential rates for associations, foundations, and non-profit organizations. [Contact us](/contact) for a customized offer.

### Can I get a trial of the Enterprise version?

Yes, we offer a 30-day trial period to evaluate the Enterprise version. [Contact us](/contact) to learn more.
