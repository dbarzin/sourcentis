## An open-source solution to master your IS

At a time when cyberattacks are multiplying and becoming more complex, information system mapping is becoming an essential pillar of any cybersecurity strategy. Mercator is a tool designed to help you **know, understand, and master** all the components of your information system.

---

## Why Mercator?

Mercator addresses a fundamental need: **having a clear and structured view** of your IS to better protect it. Born from field experience and aligned with ANSSI recommendations, Mercator is designed for CISOs, IT managers, and technical teams seeking a pragmatic and accessible solution.

### Founding Principles

**🎯 Ease of Use**
Intuitive interface enabling rapid adoption by both technical and business teams.

**📊 ANSSI Compliance**
Adherence to best practices recommended by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI).

**🔓 Open Source**
Open source code guaranteeing transparency, customization, and independence.

**🤝 Collaboration**
Easy information sharing between teams for collaborative IT management.

---

## An innovative approach to mapping

Unlike traditional solutions, which are often complex and expensive, Mercator adopts a **user-centric** approach:

- **Multi-dimensional view**: Explore your IT system from different perspectives (business, technical, security)
- **Integrated compliance analysis**: Automatically calculate your maturity levels
- **Scalability**: From small IT systems to complex infrastructures
- **Interoperability**: REST APIs for integration into your existing ecosystem

---

## Who uses Mercator?

Mercator is deployed in a variety of organizations worldwide:

- **Healthcare Facilities**: ISO 27001 and HDS-certified hospitals
- **Higher Education Institutions**: Graduate schools and universities
- **Private Companies**: SMEs and large corporations
- **Public Organizations**: Research centers and government agencies

---

## Project Genesis

Mercator was born from a simple observation: **existing mapping tools are often ill-suited** to the real needs of organizations, particularly SMEs and public sector entities. Too complex, too expensive, or too rigid, they prevent rapid and effective adoption.

The project was designed to:
- Democratize access to IT mapping
- Offer a credible open-source alternative
- Align with recognized standards (ANSSI)
- Foster knowledge sharing within the community
